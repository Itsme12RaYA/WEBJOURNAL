           <p class="intro">Data science is a multi-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and 
            systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured, semi-structured and unstructured data.
            Data science is much more than simply analyzing data. It offers a range of roles and requires a 
            range of skills.</p> <br> <br>

              <p class="intro">Data can be defined as a representation of facts, concepts, or instructions in a formalized manner, 
            which should be suitable for communication, interpretation, or processing, by human or electronic 
            machines. It can be described as unprocessed facts and figures. It is represented with the help of 
            characters such as alphabets (A-Z, a-z), digits (0-9) or special characters (+, -, /, *, <,>, =, etc.). </p>
            <p class="intro"> Data processing is the re-structuring or re-ordering of data by people or machines to increase their 
usefulness and add values for a particular purpose. Data processing consists of the following basic
steps - input, processing, and output. These three steps constitute the data processing cycle.</p>
<img src="images/cycle.png" width="1000px" height="240px"><br>
<li>Input − in this step, the input data is prepared in some convenient form for processing. <br> The 
form will depend on the processing machine. For example, when electronic computers are used,<br> the input data can be recorded on any one of the several types of storage medium, 
such as hard disk, CD, flash disk and so on.</li><br>
<li>Processing − in this step, the input data is changed to produce data in a more useful form. <br>
For example, interest can be calculated on deposit to a bank, or a summary of sales for the 
month can be calculated from the sales orders.</li>
<br> <li> Output − at this stage, the result of the proceeding processing step is collected. The 
particular form of the output data depends on the use of the data. <br>For example, output data 
may be payroll for employees. </li>
<p class="intro">Data types from Data Analytics perspective 
From a data analytics point of view, it is important to understand that there are three common types 
of data types or structures: Structured, Semi-structured, and Unstructured data types.</p>
<p><em>Structured Data</em>   is data that adheres to a pre-defined data model and is therefore straightforward to 
analyze. Structured data conforms to a tabular format with a relationship between the different 
rows and columns. Common examples of structured data are Excel files or SQL databases. Each 
of these has structured rows and columns that can be sorted.</p> 
<p><em>Semi-structured Data</em>   is a form of structured data that does not conform with the formal structure 
    of data models associated with relational databases or other forms of data tables, but nonetheless, 
    contains tags or other markers to separate semantic elements and enforce hierarchies of records 
    and fields within the data. Therefore, it is also known as a self-describing structure. Examples of 
    semi-structured data include JSON and XML are forms of semi-structured data.</p> 
    <p><em>Unstructured Data</em>  Unstructured data is information that either does not have a predefined data model or is not 
        organized in a pre-defined manner. Unstructured information is typically text-heavy but may 
        contain data such as dates, numbers, and facts as well. This results in irregularities and ambiguities 
        that make it difficult to understand using traditional programs as compared to data stored in 
        structured databases. Common examples of unstructured data include audio, video files or NoSQL databases.</p>
