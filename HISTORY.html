            Emerging technology is a term generally used to describe a new technology, but it may also refer
            to the continuing development of existing technology; it can have slightly different meanings when
            used in different areas, such as media, business, science, or education. The term commonly refers
            to technologies that are currently developing, or that are expected to be available within the next
            five to ten years, and is usually reserved for technologies that are creating or are expected to create significant social or economic effects. Technological evolution is a theory of radical
            transformation of society through technological development <br>

            Introduction to the Industrial Revolution (IR)
            The Industrial Revolution was a period of major industrialization and innovation that took
            place during the late 1700s and early 1800s. An Industrial Revolution at its core occurs
            when a society shifts from using tools to make products to use new sources of energy, such
            as coal, to power machines in factories. The revolution started in England, with a series of
            innovations to make labor more efficient and productive. The Industrial Revolution was a
            time when the manufacturing of goods moved from small shops and homes to large
            factories. This shift brought about changes in culture as people moved from rural areas to
            big cities in order to work.
            The American Industrial Revolution commonly referred to as the Second Industrial
            Revolution, started sometime between 1820 and 1870. The impact of changing the way
            items was manufactured had a wide reach. Industries such as textile manufacturing,
            mining, glass making, and agriculture all had undergone changes. For example, prior to
            the Industrial Revolution, textiles were primarily made of wool and were handspun.
            From the first industrial revolution (mechanization through water and steam power) to the
            mass production and assembly lines using electricity in the second, the fourth industrial
            revolution will take what was started in the third with the adoption of computers and
            automation and enhance it with smart and autonomous systems fueled by data and machine
            learning.
            Generally, the following industrial revolutions fundamentally changed and transfer the
            world around us into modern society.
            • The steam engine,
            • The age of science and mass production, and
            • The rise of digital technology
            • Smart and autonomous systems fueled by data and machine learning   <br>   </p>  <p class="intro"> 
                Historical Background (IR 1.0, IR 2.0, IR 3.0)
                The industrial revolution began in Great Britain in the late 1770s before spreading to the rest of
                Europe. The first European countries to be industrialized after England were Belgium, France, and
                the German states. The final cause of the Industrial Revolution was the effects created by the
                Agricultural Revolution. As previously stated, the Industrial Revolution began in Britain in the
                18th century due in part to an increase in food production, which was the key outcome of the
                Agricultural Revolution.  </p>

                    Industrial Revolution (IR 1.0)
The Industrial Revolution (IR) is described as a transition to new manufacturing processes. IR was
first coined in the 1760s, during the time where this revolution began. The transitions in the first
IR included going from hand production methods to machines, the increasing use of steam power
(see Figure 1.1), the development of machine tools and the rise of the factory system.

<p class="intro">
    Industrial Revolution (IR 2.0)
    The Second IR, also known as the Technological Revolution, began somewhere in the 1870s. The
    advancements in IR 2.0 included the development of methods for manufacturing interchangeable
    parts and widespread adoption of pre-existing technological systems such as telegraph and railroad
    networks. This adoption allowed the vast movement of people and ideas, enhancing
    communication. Moreover, new technological systems were introduced, such as electrical power  </p>

<p class="intro">
    Industrial Revolution (IR 3.0)
    Then came the Third Industrial Revolution (IR 3.0). IR 3.0 introduced the transition from 
    mechanical and analog electronic technology to digital electronics (see Figure 1.3) which began 
    from the late 1950s. Due to the shift towards digitalization, IR 3.0 was given the nickname, “Digital 
    Revolution”. The core factor of this revolution is the mass production and widespread use of 
    digital logic circuits and its derived technologies such as the computer, handphones and the 
    Internet. These technological innovations have arguably transformed traditional production and 
    business techniques enabling people to communicate with another without the need of being 
    physically present. Certain practices that were enabled during IR 3.0 is still being practiced until 
    this current day, for example – the proliferation of digital computers and digital record.

<p class="intro">
    Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR 4.0)
    Now, with advancements in various technologies such as robotics, Internet of Things (IoT see 
    Figure 1.4), additive manufacturing and autonomous vehicles, the term “Fourth Industrial 
    Revolution” or IR 4.0 was coined by Klaus Schwab, the founder and executive chairman of World 
    Economic Forum, in the year 2016. The technologies mentioned above are what you call – cyberphysical systems. A cyber-physical system is a mechanism that is controlled or monitored by 
    computer-based algorithms, tightly integrated with the Internet and its users.One example that is being widely practiced in industries today is the usage of Computer Numerical 
    Control (CNC) machines. These machines are operated by giving it instructions using a computer. 
    Another major breakthrough that is associated with IR 4.0 is the adoption of Artificial Intelligence 
    (AI), where we can see it being implemented into our smartphones. AI is also one of the main 
    elements that give life to Autonomous Vehicles and Automated Robots      </p>
