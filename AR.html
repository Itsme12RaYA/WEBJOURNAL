            additional, virtual content that is presented through computer graphics.

      <H4 class="cult">  <br>   <p  class="intro"> Augmented reality (AR) is a form of emerging technology that allows users to overlay computergenerated content in the real world. AR refers to a live view of a physical real-world environment 
        whose elements are merged with augmented computer-generated images creating a mixed reality. 
      <br><em> reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR) vs Mixed reality (MR)</em><br>
      With constant development in computer vision and the exponential advancement of computer 
      processing power, virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR) 
      technology is becoming more and more prominent. With some overlap in the applications and 
      functions of these emerging technologies, sometimes these terms get confused or are used 
      incorrectly.  ,<p><img src="images/mx.png" alt="" width="1000px" height="250px" justify-content="center"> </p>

       <p  class="intro"> Virtual Reality (VR)<br>
      VR is fully immersive, which tricks your senses into thinking you’re in a different environment or 
      world apart from the real world. Using a head-mounted display (HMD) or headset, you’ll 
      experience a computer-generated world of imagery and sounds in which you can manipulate 
      objects and move around using haptic controllers while tethered to a console or PC.<br></p>
      <p  class="intro">Mixed Reality (MR)<br>
Mixed Reality (MR), sometimes referred to as hybrid reality, is the merging of real and virtual 
worlds to produce new environments and visualizations where physical and digital objects co-exist 
and interact in real-time.</p>
