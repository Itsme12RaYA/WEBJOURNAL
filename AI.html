                advantageous technology still, it has some disadvantages which we need to keep in our mind while 
                creating an AI system. Following are the disadvantages of AI</p>

        <h3 id="tai">History Of Artificial Intelligence</h3>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence is not a new word and not a new technology for researchers. This technology 
is much older than you would imagine. Even there are the myths of Mechanical men in Ancient 
Greek and Egyptian Myths. The following are some milestones in the history of AI which define 
the journey from the AI generation to till date development.</p>

            <p>Artificial Intelligence can be divided into various types, there are mainly two types of the main 
                categorization which are based on capabilities and based on functionally of AI, as shown in figure 3.5. 
                Following is the flow diagram which explains the types of AI.</p>

            <p class="title">A. Based on Capabilities</p>
      
                <p>1. Weak AI or Narrow AI:
                    <br>
                    ‚û¢ Narrow AI is a type of AI which is able to perform a dedicated task with 
                    intelligence. The most common and currently available AI is Narrow AI in the 
                    world of Artificial Intelligence.
                    
                    <br>
                    ‚û¢ Narrow AI cannot perform beyond its field or limitations, as it is only trained for 
                    one specific task. Hence it is also termed as weak AI. Narrow AI can fail in 
                    unpredictable ways if it goes beyond its limits.
                    <br>
                    ‚û¢ Apple Siri is a good example of Narrow AI, but it operates with a limited predefined range of functions.
                    <br>
                    ‚û¢ IBM's Watson supercomputer also comes under Narrow AI, as it uses an Expert 
                    system approach combined with Machine learning and natural language processing.
                   <br> ‚û¢ Some Examples of Narrow AI are Google translate, playing chess, purchasing 
                    suggestions on e-commerce sites, self-driving cars, speech recognition, and image 
                    recognition.<br><br>
                    2. General AI:
                    <br>
                    ‚û¢ General AI is a type of intelligence that could perform any intellectual task with 
                    efficiency like a human.
                    <br>
                    ‚û¢ The idea behind the general AI to make such a system that could be smarter and 
                    think like a human on its own.
                    <br>
                    ‚û¢ Currently, there is no such system exists which could come under general AI and 
                    can perform any task as perfect as a human. It may arrive within the next 20 or so 
                    years but it has challenges relating to hardware, the energy consumption required 
                    in today‚Äôs powerful machines, and the need to solve for catastrophic memory loss 
                    that affects even the most advanced deep learning algorithms of today
                    <br>
f                    ‚û¢ The worldwide researchers are now focused on developing machines with General 
                    AI.
                    <br>
                    ‚û¢ As systems with general AI are still under research, and it will take lots of effort 
                    and time to develop such systems.<br><br>
                    <br>
                    3. Super AI:
                    <br>
                    ‚û¢ Super AI is a level of Intelligence of Systems at which machines could surpass 
                    human intelligence, and can perform any task better than a human with cognitive 
                    properties. This refers to aspects like general wisdom, problem solving and 
                    creativity. It is an outcome of general AI.
                    <br>
                    ‚û¢ Some key characteristics of strong AI include capability include the ability to think, 
                    to reason solve the puzzle, make judgments, plan, learn, and communicate on its 
                    own.
                    <br>
                    ‚û¢ Super AI is still a hypothetical concept of Artificial Intelligence. The development 
                    of such systems in real is still a world-changing task.
    <br><br>            
                    <p class="title">B. Based on the functionality</p>
                    <p >1. Reactive Machines                    <br>

                        ‚û¢ Purely reactive machines are the most basic types of Artificial Intelligence.
                        <br>
                        ‚û¢ Such AI systems do not store memories or past experiences for future actions.
                        <br>
                        ‚û¢ These machines only focus on current scenarios and react on it as per possible best 
                        action.
                        <br>
                        ‚û¢ IBM's Deep Blue system is an example of reactive machines.
                        <br>
                        ‚û¢ Google's AlphaGo is also an example of reactive machines.
                       <br>
                        2. Limited Memory
                        <br>
                        ‚û¢ Limited memory machines can store past experiences or some data for a short 
                        period of time.
                        <br>
                        ‚û¢ These machines can use stored data for a limited time period only.
                        <br>
                        ‚û¢ Self-driving cars are one of the best examples of Limited Memory systems. These 
                        cars can store the recent speed of nearby cars, the distance of other cars, speed 
                        limits, and other information to navigate the road.
                       <br>
                        3. Theory of Mind
                        <br>
                        ‚û¢ Theory of Mind AI should understand human emotions, people, beliefs, and be able 
                        to interact socially like humans.
                        <br>
                        ‚û¢ This type of AI machines is still not developed, but researchers are making lots of 
                        efforts and improvement for developing such AI machines.
                       <br>
                        4. Self-Awareness
                        <br>
                        ‚û¢ Self-awareness AI is the future of Artificial Intelligence. These machines will be 
                        super intelligent and will have their own consciousness, sentiments, and selfawareness.
                        <br>
                        ‚û¢ These machines will be smarter than the human mind.
                        <br>
                        ‚û¢ Self-Awareness AI does not exist in reality still and it is a hypothetical concept.</p>
