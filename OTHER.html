            <h3>Nanotechnology</h3>
            <p>Nanotechnology is science, engineering, and technology conducted at the nanoscale, which is 
              about 1 to 100 nanometers. Nanoscience and nanotechnology are the study and application of 
              extremely small things and can be used across all the other science fields, such as chemistry, 
              biology, physics, materials science, and engineering.

            <h3>Biotechnology</h3>
            <p>
              It is the broad area of biology involving living systems and organisms to develop or make products, 
            or "any technological application that uses biological systems, living organisms, or derivatives 
            thereof, to make or modify products or processes for specific use"  </p>

            <h3>Blockchain technology</h3>
            <p>Originally blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked 
              using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptography hash of the previous block, a timestamp, 
              and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree).
              A blockchain is, in the simplest of terms, a time-stamped series of immutable records of data that 
              is managed by a cluster of computers not owned by any single entity. Each of these blocks of data 
              (i.e. block) is secured and bound to each other using cryptographic principles (i.e. chain).
              “Blocks” on the blockchain are made up of digital pieces of information. </p>

            <h3> Cloud computing
            </h3>
            <p>Cloud computing is a means of networking remote servers that are hosted on the Internet. Rather 
              than storing and processing data on a local server, or a PC's hard drive, one of the following three 
              types of cloud infrastructure is used.

            <h3>Quantum computing</h3>
            <p>Quantum computers truly do represent the next generation of computing. Unlike classic 
              computers, they derive their computing power by harnessing the power of quantum physics. 
              Because of the rather nebulous science behind it, a practical, working quantum computer still 
              remains a flight of fancy.

            <h3>Autonomic Computing</h3>
            <p>Autonomic computing (AC) is an approach to address the complexity and evolution problems in 
              software systems. It is a self-managing computing model named after, and patterned on, the human 
              body's autonomic nervous system. An autonomic computing system would control the functioning 
              of computer applications and systems without input from the user, in the same way, that the 
              autonomic nervous system regulates body systems without conscious input from the individual.   </p>

            <h3>Computer vision</h3>
            <p>It is an interdisciplinary scientific field that deals with how computers can be made to gain a highlevel understanding of digital images or videos. From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to 
              automate tasks that the human visual system can do. 
              Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding 
              digital images, and extraction of high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce 
              numerical or symbolic information, e.g. in the forms of decisions. Understanding in this context 
              means the transformation of visual images (the input of the retina) into descriptions of the world 
              that can interface with other thought processes and elicit appropriate action.

            <h3>Embedded systems</h3>
            <p>It is a controller with a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electrical system, often 
              with real-time computing constraints. It is embedded as part of a complete device often including 
              hardware and mechanical parts. Embedded systems control many devices in common use 
              today. Ninety-eight percent of all microprocessors manufactured are used in embedded systems.   </p>

            <h3>Cybersecurity</h3>
            <p>Cybersecurity is often confused with information security but it focuses on protecting computer 
              systems from unauthorized access or being otherwise damaged or made inaccessible. Information 
              security is a broader category that looks to protect all information assets, whether in hard copy or 
              in digital form.

            <h3>Additive manufacturing (3D Printing)
            </h3>
            <p>Additive manufacturing (AM) describes types of advanced manufacturing that are used to create 
              three-dimensional structures out of plastics, metals, polymers and other materials that can be 
              sprayed through a nozzle or aggregated in a vat. These constructs are added layer by layer in realtime based on digital design. The simplicity and low cost of AM machines, combined with the 
              scope of their potential creations, could profoundly alter global and local economies and affect 
              international security
